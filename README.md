There some controversy over Bangladeshi people that they are not well maintained the social distance but the google mobility data show that
Bangladeshi are well maintained the social distance even better than developed and more social aware country like United States,
also Bngladesh and New York got the infection almost similar time where New York has too many confirmed cases and deaths but 
Bangladeshi and New York people almost maintained same level social distance which are found by Google Mobility Data.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here some calculation that show us the population density and if just a percent of people go out for the daily necessary then 
the population density per kilometer as country wise there Bangladesh have 11 people per km^2.Also England, Italy, United States have 5,2,0.33 respectively. And city wise Dhaka has 685 and New York 248 people if just a percent come out. But now about more than core people leave the Dhaka city and go to village, so Dhaka have now about 1 core people and the density also should be half of the total which about to 300 people per square km. But there are many other factor like the other develpoed country and South Asian country are not similar design. If we look, then find that there are grocery and other shop just for walking distance frequently and unstructured. But the pattern in New York like city or United States like country the market are sequentially 2,3 kilometers away from each other.So, if you go out, you see too many people on the road and market for this population density and country design pattern. So, a journalist when take shoot, we assume that he have eye vision(also field vishion) field half a kilometer and from two side it almost a kilometer and he/she should see near 600 people theoritically also market like Kauranbazar which is the main grocery market in Dhaka you see too many people in a Day. And mostly journalist shoot their video on city downtown area like Farmgate, Gulistan,Puran Paltan, Gulshan, Motijheel.As we say, according to the google mobility data and calculation there is no way to argu that Bangladeshi people are not maintained social distance as wall as the other country.




-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some calculation : 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bangladesh population density for 1% per km : 
11.156199999999998

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

United State population density for 1%  per km : 
0.94

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

England population density for 1% per km : 
2.59

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Italy population density for 1% per km : 
5.3

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
France population density for 1% per km: 
1.1737




!@$@$#%#%#^#^%#*&(@*!&*&@&^!#%^%!%@&!^#
Dhaka and New York

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dhaka population density for 1% per km : 
685.61

About 1.10 core people leave the city at present now, so current population about 1 core, the density should be almost 300/km^2

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New York population density for 1% per km : 
270.0

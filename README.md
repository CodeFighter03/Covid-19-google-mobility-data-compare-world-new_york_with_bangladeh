There some controversy over Bangladeshi people that they are not well maintained the social distance but the google mobility data show that
Bangladeshi are well maintained the social distance even better than developed and more social aware country like United States,
also Bngladesh and New York got the infection almost similar time where New York has too many confirmed cases and deaths but 
Bangladeshi and New York people almost maintained same level social distance which are found by Google Mobility Data.


Here some calculation that show us the population density and if just a percent of people go out for the daily necessary then 
the population density per kilometer as country wise there Bangladesh have 11 people per km^2.Also England, Italy, United States have 5,2,0.33 respectively. And city wise Dhaka has 685 and New York 248 people if just a percent come out. But there are many other factor like the other develpoed country and South Asian country are not similar design. If we look, then find that there are grocery and other shop just for walking distance and unstructured. But the pattern in New York like city or United States like country the market are sequentially 2,3 kilometers away from each other.So, if you come , you see too many people on the road and market for this population density and country design pattern.As we say, according to the google mobility data and calculation there is no way to say that Bangladeshi people are not maintained social distance as wall as the other country.
